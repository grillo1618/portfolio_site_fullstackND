* First, middle, last, I thank Allah (swt) for giving me the ability
  to accomplish this Project!
  Him! Lord of the Worlds! He is One and none but Him!

  awesome cat-hat somes.
* Lastly, I would love to give credit to Mackenzie Child, that had a
  great video on portfolio website coding, which inspired me to do mine
  with such a styling (sometimes) one needs to look for good people
  to be inspired to do good things.
