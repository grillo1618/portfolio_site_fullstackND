## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Also, a modern web browser is needed.

Yarn is prefered over npm. So you could optionally install yarn.
